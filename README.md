# SQL Employee Tracker

## Introduction
This project is a result of our bootcamp's week 12 homework assignment. Students were expected to create an employee tracker for an organization and their database using Node.js, My SQL, and Inquirer.js. The project repository can be found [here](https://github.com/graycodesnu/SQL-employee-tracker) and the demo video can be found [here]().

## Goals 

+ Create and seed a database with existing employee information using MySQL
+ Create an inquirer prompt menu with options to view departments, roles, and employees; add a department, role, and employee; and update an employee role
+ When a user chooses to view either departments, roles, or employees, the corresponding table is displayed 
+ When a user chooses to add a department, employee, or role, they are prompted to enter information for each of the corresponding fields in the respective chosen table, then the data is appended to the database
+ When a user chooses to update an employee role, they are able to edit the existing information for the chosen role and it is appended to the database

## Results 
I was able to successfully complete this project, but I did stumble a bit along the way. I struggled to seed the database and needed to reach out to a tutor to finally use "source db/seeds.sql" while in MySQL for the data to seed. I also ran into a few bugs, which my Nana, the SQL Queen, helped me debug. Another bug I ran into involved my prompts not matching exactly, which caused inquirer to either exit or freeze. My classmate, Eric McGee found my error after we'd wracked our brains and scoured the code for several hours. Huge shoutout to Nana and Eric for catching my small but code-altering mistakes!
